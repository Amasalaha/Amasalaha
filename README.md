 <summary><h3>ðŸ—» Ahmed's cloud Journey</h3></summary>
 Cloud engineering is a growing field that involves the design, implementation, and maintenance of cloud-based infrastructure and services.
 Cloud computing has become a highly sought-after field for many individuals due to the exciting opportunities and potential for innovation that it offers. 
 As more organizations adopt cloud-based solutions to improve their operations and reduce costs,
 there is a high demand for skilled professionals who can design, implement, and manage cloud-based systems., here is  the beginner roadmap that helped to get started.

1. Learn the Basics
- The first step in becoming a cloud engineer is to learn the basics of cloud computing. 
This includes understanding the different types of cloud services, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), 
and Software as a Service (SaaS). You should also learn about cloud deployment models, including public, private, and hybrid clouds. 
Familiarizing yourself with cloud computing terminology and concepts will help you better understand the field.

2. Choose a Cloud Platform
- There are several cloud platforms available, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Each platform has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to choose one that aligns with your goals and interests. 
You can start by exploring each platform's website, documentation, and tutorials to get a sense of what they offer.

3. Get Hands-On Experience
- One of the best ways to learn cloud engineering is by getting hands-on experience. 
You can start by setting up a personal account on your chosen cloud platform and experimenting with the different services and tools. 
You can also try building a simple web application or deploying a pre-built application on the cloud platform.

4. Get Certified
- Cloud certifications can be a valuable way to demonstrate your knowledge and expertise to potential employers. 
There are several cloud certifications available, including AWS Certified Solutions Architect, Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate, 
and Google Cloud Certified - Associate Cloud Engineer. These certifications require passing an exam that tests your knowledge of the cloud platform and its services.

5. Join a Community
- Joining a community of cloud engineers can be a great way to learn from others, share your experiences, a
nd stay up-to-date with the latest trends and developments in the field. You can join online communities, such as forums and social media groups, 
or attend local meetups and conferences.

6. Keep Learning
- Cloud computing is a rapidly evolving field, so it's important to keep learning and updating your skills. You can stay current by reading industry blogs, 
attending webinars and workshops, and taking online courses. Staying up-to-date with the latest trends 
and technologies will help you become a better cloud engineer and advance your career.

In conclusion, becoming a cloud engineer requires a solid understanding of cloud computing basics, hands-on experience, certifications, community involvement, 
and ongoing learning. By following this beginner roadmap, you can start your journey towards becoming a skilled cloud engineer.
